# Simple Todo List | React

This code creates a simple TodoList component that displays a list of todos. The component has a local state todos, which is an array of tasks, and newTodo, which is a new task that the user enters in the text field.


## Features

- The component displays a list of tasks and provides the ability to add new tasks and delete existing ones. Each task is represented by a list element (<li>), and each task has a "Remove" button that allows you to remove the task from the list.

#### Please note that all functionality is implemented using hooks such as "useState".
